# Tloader

##Install TLauncher using archived versions of ".tlauncher" and ".minecraft" files, along with a portable version of Java. This method allows you to install TLauncher without needing administrator privileges, making it ideal for use on school or work computers.

I do not publicly distribute any files related to TLauncher or Minecraft. This is not intended of being used in any commercial way.
