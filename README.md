# Tloader

### Install TLauncher using archived versions of ".tlauncher" and ".minecraft" files, along with a portable version of Java. This allows you to install TLauncher without needing administrator privileges, making it ideal for use on school or work computers.
> [!NOTE]
> TLoader acts as a launcher and downloader for Tlauncher. Once the program set up the game files it will act as a launcher for it.


### How to use:
1. Dowload the archived version of TLauncher (.tlauncher), Minecraft (.minecraft), javap(archived jdk 21) and Tloader.exe
2. Unzip the files
3. Copy the files in to the same directory as the Tloader
4. Open Tloader and wait

### Clone the project
```
git clone --branch dev https://github.com/Dori067/TLoader --recursive
cd Tloader
```
