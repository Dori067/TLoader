# Tloader

## This project is completely useless becase you can do the same just by downloading the offical Tlauncher Linux version and running it using java on windows (portable java).



### Install TLauncher using archived versions of ".tlauncher" and ".minecraft" files, along with a portable version of Java. This allows you to install TLauncher without needing administrator privileges, making it ideal for use on school or work computers.
> [!NOTE]
> TLoader acts as a launcher and preparer for Tlauncher. Once the program prepared the game files it will act as a launcher for it.


### How to use:
1. Dowload the archived version of TLauncher (.tlauncher), Minecraft (.minecraft), javap(archived jdk 21) and Tloader.exe.
2. Unzip the folders.
3. Put the unzipped folders in the same folder/directory as the Tloader
4. Delete the extra folder that was made when it was unzipped (Windows makes an extra folder inside that same folder)
5. Open Tloader and wait for it to finish copying.
6. Reopen Tloader and done.

### Clone the project
```
git clone --branch dev https://github.com/Dori067/TLoader --recursive
cd Tloader
```


this whole project is kinda useless, if you wanna make something out of it, sure why not
